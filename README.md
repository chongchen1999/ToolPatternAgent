# LLM Tool Pattern Implementation

## Overview
This project implements a tool pattern enabling Language Learning Models (LLMs) to interact with external functions using XML-structured prompts. This approach allows LLMs to extend their functionality and access information beyond their training data.

## Features
- XML-based tool call pattern enabling function integration.
- Three tools demonstrating:
  - API interaction (HackerNews search example)
  - Data processing
  - External service integration
- Error handling and response formatting.
- Basic tests for tool execution, error handling, and response validation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Python 3.8+**
- **Groq API access**
- Libraries: `requests`, `json`

## Getting Started
### Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/LLM-Tool-Pattern.git
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Open the Jupyter notebook LLM_Tool_Pattern_Starter.ipynb.
Implement additional tools as needed within Section 5.
Run tests in Section 6 to validate your implementation.
Project Structure
Section 1: Setup and utility functions for parsing XML tags.
Section 2: Tool decorator to define and validate tools.
Section 3: ToolAgent class to execute and manage tools.
Section 4: Example tool (search_hackernews) with API interaction.
Section 5: Additional tool implementations.
Section 6: Basic tests for tool validation and error handling.
Testing
To run the basic tests, execute the cells in Section 6 of the notebook. These tests check:

Tool creation and decorator functionality.
Tool execution and response validation.
Error handling for invalid input.
Demo Video
A video demonstration is included in the repository, showing:

Tool calls and XML response parsing.
Each implemented tool in action.
Error handling examples.
